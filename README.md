# Redux_Clicking_App
A very simple clicking app. It is so simple, it might be insulting.

Also, using React and Redux for that is kinda overkill, but whatever.

Important: This app was created in an eviroment where no access to npm was allowed. Therefore, babel, react and redux are imported as scripts. It changes a little the way most of the things are coded.
